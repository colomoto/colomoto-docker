AstroLogics is a Python package designed for analysing monotonous Boolean model ensemble, a product of Boolean model synthesis from method such as Bonesis.

Our framework includes three major processes

- **Dynamical properties analysis**:
        Calculated distance between models through probabilistic approxmition via MaBoSS.
- **Logical function evaluation**:
        Features logical equation and identify key logical features between model clusters
- **Statistical analysis**:
        Perform statistical analysis between model clusters to identify key logical featuers between clusters


The tool is developed and maintained by the group [Computational Systems Biology of Cancer](https://institut-curie.org/team/barillot) at Institut Curie, Paris, France.
