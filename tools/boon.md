The BooN project provides a complete set of functionalities for Boolean Network (BooN) analysis. It was originally designed to explore the modeling of genetic networks by Boolean networks. The documentation related to the functions can be found here: https://franck-delaplace.github.io/BooN/. It includes

- the definition of a Boolean network with the possibility to load and save it;
- the computation of the model of dynamics with respect to a mode policy;
- the definition of the interaction graph including a modular decomposition of the interaction;
- the computation of equilibria based on dynamics model;
- the efficient symbolic computation of stable states based on SAT solver;
- the controllability analysis predicting which variables must be frozen to reach the expected goal at stable states based on possibility and necessity query;
- also different basic functionalities are included as: update formula and importing/exporting to a text file the Boolean network.
