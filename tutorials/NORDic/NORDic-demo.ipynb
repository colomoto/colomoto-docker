    "Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (MedGen Concept ID \"C1275808\") is a disorder that affects normal breathing. People with this disorder take shallow breaths (hypoventilate), especially during sleep, resulting in a shortage of oxygen and a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinarily, the part of the nervous system that controls involuntary body processes (autonomic nervous system) would react to such an imbalance by stimulating the individual to breathe more deeply or wake up. This nervous system reaction is impaired in people with CCHS.  [(source)](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/congenital-central-hypoventilation-syndrome/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the CCHS cases can be linked to a mutation in the PHOX2B gene, and a large percentage of cases are related to an alanine expansion which length might be correlated with the severity of the symptoms.\n",

    "- If there is an explosion in RAM use (happens for a good personal computer when the number of edges fed to the Boolean network is >3,000), reduce the number of edges by playing with parameters score and tau\n",
    "- If no model is found, decrease the value of parameter bin_thres in [0,0.5], or increase max_maxclause (leave it smaller than 10, otherwise the RAM goes KABOOM)\n",
    "- If there are too many models, add more constraints by increasing the value of score, tau, or bin_thres, or setting exact=True (meaning that any solution should use ALL edges fed to the solver)\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, as a general rule: if you prefer having a denser network at the end of the inference, decrease the value of bin_thres. On the contrary, if you prefer putting more credence on experimental contraints, bin_thres should be increased.\n",
